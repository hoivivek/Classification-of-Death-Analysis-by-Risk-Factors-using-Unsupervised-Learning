#Project Abstract

The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  explore  the  presence  of  patterns  in  multiple  health  risk  factors  across 
different  countries  and  years  ranging  from  1990  -  2019  using  unsupervised  learning.  The  analysis 
methods  used  include  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  and  clustering  methods:  K-means 
and  Hierarchical  Clustering.  PCA  was  applied  to  the  data  to  reduce  dimensionality  of  the  data  to 
enable  easier  visualization  and  interpretation.  The  clustering  methods  helped  to  define  groups 
with  similar  health  risk  characteristics  that  can  help  to  design  potential  interventions  for  public 
health.  These  clusters  provided  valuable  insights  into  the  distribution  of  various  health  risks, 
such  as  high  BMI,  high  LDL  cholesterol,  smoking,  and  alcohol  use,  among  different  countries 
which  were  important  characteristics  from  the  study.  The  analysis  revealed  significant 
relationships  between  different  health  risks.  The  study  shows  that  the  techniques  of  unsupervised 
learning  can  be  very  useful  in  providing  decision  makers  with  valuable  insights  from  large  and 
complicated  datasets  in  health  care  and  thus  provide  a  strong  basis  for  evidence-based  decision 
making in health care systems.
